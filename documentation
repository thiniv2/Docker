to install homebrew to 42 computer run the following command:

$ rm -rf $HOME/.brew && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew $HOME/.brew && echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.brew/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc && brew update

$ brew install docker
$ brew install docker-machine

1. creating a virtual machine:
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox Char

'-d' Driver to create machine with

2. getting the virtual machines ip-address:
$ docker-machine ip Char

3. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your
terminal:
$ eval $(docker-machine env Char)

we got this by running the following command:
$ docker-machine env Char

Which then gave us the output:

export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/thinguye/.docker/machine/machines/Char"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="Char"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env Char)

4. getting the 'hello-world' container:
$ docker pull hello-world

5. launching hello-world container:
$ docker run hello-world

6. launching nginx container:
$ docker run --name overlord -p 5000:80 --restart=always -d nginx

-p: this option maps the container port 80 to port 5000
-d: Run container in background and print container ID
To configure the restart policy for a container, use the --restart flag when using the docker run command.
'always' = Always restart the container if it stops. If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when
Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted.

7. get internal ip address of the overlord
$ docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' overlord

'-f' format the output using the given Go template

8. docker run -it --rm alpine

'-i' interactive mode (keeps STDIN open even if not attached)
'-t' allocate pseudo-tty
'--rm' automatically remove the container when it exits

9. 
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get upgrade -y
$ apt-get install -y build-essential git

'-y' prompt yes
'build-essential' includes 'gcc' and 'make'

10. creating a volume
$ docker volume create hatchery

11. list volumes
$ docker volume ls

12. Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
itself is named spawning-pool.

$ docker run --name spawning-pool -d  --restart=on-failure -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings -v hatchery mysql

'-e' Set environment variables
'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD' Set Password for the MySQL root user. This variable is mandatory.
'MYSQL_DATABASE' Create a New Database on startup. This is optional. If a user is created, the user will be granted superuser access to the database.
'-d' run container in background and print container ID
'on-failure' Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.
'-v' or '--volume' Consists of three fields, separated by colon characters (:). The fields must be in the correct order, and the meaning of each field is not immediately obvious.
In the case of bind mounts, the first field is the path to the file or directory on the host machine.
The second field is the path where the file or directory is mounted in the container.
The third field is optional, and is a comma-separated list of options, such as ro, consistent, delegated, cached, z, and Z.


13. Print the environment variables of the spawning-pool container in one command,
to be sure that you have configured your container properly.

$ docker inspect -f '{{ .Config.Env}}' spawning-pool

14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The container
should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual
machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database
service. You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, with the
IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.

$ docker run --name lair -d -p 8080:80 --link spawning-pool wordpress

'--link' addd link to another container

15. launch phpmyadmin

$ docker run --name roach-warden -p 8081:80 --link spawning-pool -d phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

16. look up spawning-pool container's log in real time

$ docker logs -f spawning pool

The -f or --follow option will show live log output.

17. display currenlty active container in Char machine

$ docker ps

18. relaunch overlord container

$ docker restart overlord

19. launch container named Abathur....

$ docker run --name Abathur -p 3000:3000 -v ~/:/root -dit python:2-slim

'-d' Run container in background and print container ID
'-i' interactive mode
'-t' allocate a pseudo-TTY

$ docker exec Abathur pip install flask
$ echo 'from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route("/")\ndef hello_world():\n\treturn "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"' > app.py
$ docker exec -e FLASK_APP=/root/docker/app.py Abathur flask --host=0.0.0.0 -p 3000

if we run only '$ docker exec Abathur flask run' it says we need to provide "FLASK_APP", thus the ' -e FLASK_APP/root/docker/app.py'
make the server publicly available simply by adding --host=0.0.0.0

20. create a local swarm, Char should be its manager

$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip Char)

'$(docker-machine ip Char)' gets the ip of the Char machine
The --advertise-addr flag configures the manager node to publish its address.

'docker info' shows Char machine is now a manager

21. create new virtual-machine using virtualbox driver and name it Aiur

$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox Aiur

22. Turn Aiur into a slave of the local swarm in which Char is leader (the command to
take control of Aiur is not requested).

$ docker-machine ssh Aiur "docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token worker -q) $(docker-machine ip Char)"

so what happens here is, we first log into Aiur using ssh, then we run 'docker swarm join --token' and we get the worker token
using '$(docker swarm join-token worker -q)', the '-q' flag means 'Only display token.'
then finally we get the ip of the Char machine using: $(docker-machine ip Char)

22. Create an overlay-type internal network that you will name overmind.

$ docker network create -d overlay overmind

23. Launch a rabbitmq SERVICE that will be named orbital-command. You should
define a specific user and password for the RabbitMQ service, they can be whatever
you want. This service will be on the overmind network.

24. Launch a rabbitmq SERVICE that will be named orbital-command. You should
define a specific user and password for the RabbitMQ service, they can be whatever
you want. This service will be on the overmind network.

$ docker service create ---name orbital-command --network -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=rabbit -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=rabbit rabbitmq

'--name' specify name
'--network' specify network
'-e' set environment variables
If you wish to change the default username and password of guest / guest,
you can do so with the RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER and RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS environmental variables.

25. List all the services of the local swarm.

$ docker service ls

26. Launch a 42school/engineering-bay service in two replicas and make sure that
the service works properly (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com).
This service will be named engineering-bay and will be on the overmind network.

$ docker service create -d --name engineering-bay --network overmind --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=rabbit -e OC_PASSWD=rabbit 42school/engineering-bay

You must have an orbital-command running on your host or swarm, accessible with the same name into your network.
To connect to this orbital-command, you must set a:

OC_USERNAME : Username used to access to orbital-command
OC_PASSWD : Password used to access to orbital-command

27. Get the real-time logs of one the tasks of the engineering-bay service.

$ docker service logs -f $(docker service ps engineering-bay -f "name=engineering-bay.1" -q)

first '-f' means "Follow log output"
second '-f' is format
'-q' only display task ID

28. group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting down
the engineering-bay service won’t help at all... You must send a troup of Marines
to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two replicas,
and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided
at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... marines and will be on the
overmind network.

$ docker service create -d --name marines --network overmind --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=rabbit -e OC_PASSWD=rabbit 42school/marine-squad

29. Display all the tasks of the marines service.

$ docker service ps marines

30. Increase the number of copies of the marines service up to twenty

$ docker service scale marines=20

31. Force quit and delete all the services on the local swarm, in one command.

$ docker service rm  $(docker service ls -q)

'-q' prints only the service's ID

32. Force quit and delete all the containers (whatever their status), in one command.

$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)

'-f' force remove
'-a' Show all containers (default shows just running)
'-q' Only display numeric IDs

33. Delete all the container images stored on the Char virtual machine, in one command
as well.

$ docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)

'rmi' removes images by their ID.

34. Delete the Aiur virtual machine without using rm -rf.

$ docker-machine rm -y Aiur

'-y' prompt yes

By default it will run migrations only in the development environment.

'db:seed' Runs the db/seeds.rb file.

When we need to install a database on a new device or in a new environment,
we may want to add default data to the tables in the process.
This is called seeding the database and allows us to enter data quickly and easily to existing database tables.

Seeding a Database
In Rails, we seed a database by using Rake and the db/seeds.rb file.
